      <p>2.5 million tourists, that's how many visited Lviv in 2019 from more than 150 countries. Poles (18.3%), Belarusians (6.6%), Germans (5.4%), Turks (6.2%) and Americans (2.5%) remained traditional for us. The doubling of tourists from the United Kingdom, up to 3%, was unexpected, and for the first time in the last few years, the top 10 visiting countries included Austrians and French, 1% each.</p>

    <div class="publication-content-center">
      <p>Revenues to the city budget from the tourism industry increased by 30% and amounted to UAH 198 million, of which the tourist tax has almost doubled to UAH 10 million. One of the factors of such rapid growth was the change in the method of collecting tourist tax, in accordance with the Law of Ukraine "On Amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine and some other legislative acts of Ukraine to improve the administration and revision of certain taxes and fees" and set as a percentage of minimum wage fees, depending on the cost of temporary accommodation for one day.</p>
      <p>Also, the cost of a tourist during one day of stay increased by 20 euros and amounted to 94 euros. Inflation in Ukraine and the strengthening of the national currency have become important factors of influence here.</p>
      <p>For the second year in a row, we measure the loyalty of tourists to the city and the level of emotional load with which they return home. NPS (Net Promoter Score) increased by 17% and is in 2019 + 91% (possible range from -100% to + 100%). This indicator is an important tool for measuring the attraction of tourists and indicates further active recommendations to their relatives and friends to visit Lviv and return again by themselves. It should be noted that for several years in a row, half of the guests of our city are those who return again and again.</p>

      <p>Traditionally, almost half of tourists travel to Lviv by train (46%), with the opening of new flights and an increase in their frequency of flights, more and more visitors prefer airplanes (31%) and demand for bus services decreases (-4%).</p>
      <p>Hostels (31%) and rented apartments (30%) are gaining popularity among accommodation establishments. The percentage of those wishing to spend the night in hotels is decreasing every year and this year was 29%.</p>

        Tourists choose Lviv as a city of recreation and entertainment, delicious cuisine and ancient architecture (84%). And yet, this is a city where Ukrainian traditions and family values ​​have been preserved. Probably this is why only 20% of visitors travel on their own.
        <br>
        <br>
        Among the alternative cities that were considered when planning the trip, most Ukrainians purposefully chose Lviv, and foreigners suggested the opportunity to visit Kyiv as well. It is worth noting that on the basis of marketing research of tourists, the main competitors of Lviv are European cities, such as Prague, Krakow or Vienna. Interestingly, the alternative cities for travel are similar for both domestic and inbound tourists.
        <br>
        <br>
        One third of travelers connect Lviv with other Ukrainian cities, and about 8% - with European ones.

      <p>The Index of Tourist Attractiveness of the city, which is 4.8, and the Index of Satisfaction with Tourist Services - 4.4 (out of 5 possible points) remained consistently high. </p>
      <p>And 95% of the guests of our city will recommend their relatives and friends to visit Lviv and enjoy its atmosphere of grandeur and comfort. This is a record for 10 years of research.</p>
      <p>We will remind, interrogations are carried out to order of LKP "Center of development of tourism of Lviv" by f2f method. During 2019, more than 2,000 respondents took part.</p>
